# Welcome

*Vigiliant Crypto Snatch* is a little program that observes the current market price for your choice of currency pairs, looks for drastic reductions (dips) and then places buy orders.

The basic idea is to use the [Dollar Cost Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging) effect in a bit more clever way. By buying in fixed time intervals for a certain amount of fiat currency, one can profit from a sideways moving market with fluctuations. We can try to improve on this by also actively looking for reductions in the price to buy more cryptocurrency for the same fiat amount.

First you need to [install](installation.md) the software, then [configure](configuration.md) it. Test the program using the instructions for [running](usage.md), then choose a [deployment](deployment.md) strategy that suits your needs.

You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/martin-ueding/vigilant-crypto-snatch). Download statistics via [PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/vigilant-crypto-snatch).

In case you wonder about the name: Dips means that the price dives. Submarines dive. The HMS Vigilant is a submarine of the British Navy. But also vigilance means to observe.
