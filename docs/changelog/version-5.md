# Version 5

## Version 5.0.0

- Refactor a lot more.
- Remove `--keepalive` feature, this is on by default now.
- Remove `--dry-run` feature, use the `test-drive` command instead.
- Remove `--one-shot` feature, use the loop instead.

### Version 5.0.1

- Fix bug with marketplace factory function. Would emit `RuntimeError: Unsupported marketplace: <vigilant_crypto_snatch.configuration.yaml_configuration.YamlConfiguration object at 0x7f2b3a031840>`.

### Version 5.0.2

- The Telegram connector would hang during shutdown, I have fixed that again.

### Version 5.0.3

- Catch `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, which wasn't caught by the krakenex library. Now it will be converted into an error on the module level.

## Version 5.1.0

- Print out version number during startup.
- Add trigger option `fear_and_greed_index_below`.

## Version 5.2.0

- Fear & Greed is now included in the evaluation interface.
- More refactoring, more test coverage.
- Developer documentation includes a component diagram.

### Version 5.2.1

- Allow any log level for Telegram, including `debug`.
- Attempt withdrawal after the trade has been noted in the database. Previously, a failure during withdrawal would have dropped the trade and eventually performed it again.
- Output full exception traceback for every caught exception into the debug logging channel.
- Pause triggers for 24 hours when they have insufficient funds. This will reduce failure messages from three per 12 hours to one per 24 hours.

## Version 5.3.0

- Add a report page about user trades into the evaluation interface.
- Link to download statistics within documentation.
