It should log into the marketplace, report your balance and load the triggers. Then you can start it and have it run, but you likely want a proper deployment. Most users seem to have a Raspberry Pi, which is an affordable miniature server. It is perfectly suited to run this little Python program. You can also run it on a larger server, if you want. We will introduce a couple ways that you can deploy this program. Screen session If you log into your Linux server via SSH and start a program, it will run on the server. But when you disconnect, the program will be shut shown. This is not what we want, we want to have the service running the whole time. Therefore a simple SSH connection is not appropriate. Fortunately there are terminal multiplexers , namely screen and tmux . For our purposes both are just perfectly fine. The idea is that you have a persistent terminal on the server, and you just attach to see it, and detach from viewing it. It is still there, even if you don't see it. For that start a new screen session, and perhaps already give it a name (we use vigilant here, but you are free to choose): $ screen -S vigilant Not much will change, you will get a fresh screen. Then start the program as documented in the usage page. It should start up. Then you can Ctrl + A , then D . This will detach the session. Use screen -ls to see a list of all sessions that are open. This can look like this: $ screen -ls There is a screen on: 445439.vigilant (Detached) 1 Socket in /run/screen/S-mu. Now you can logout via SSH, and the program will still run. Later you can log back in and use screen -r vigilant to reattach the session and control it or look at the log output. Team Viewer You might have set up your Raspberry Pi with a graphical user interface and a running session. In that case you log into that session using Team Viewer or any other remote administration tool. Just open a terminal window and start the program. It will keep running when you disconnect from Team Viewer. Systemd unit A very modern approach for continuous running is to use systemd. That is the program which starts all the other programs on a modern Linux system. It needs to have a definition of the service. It is a text file which looks like this: [Unit] Description = Vigilant Crypto Snatch Service (watch) StartLimitIntervalSec = 500 StartLimitBurst = 5 After = network.target [Service] User = USERNAME ExecStart = /usr/local/bin/vigilant-crypto-snatch watch --marketplace kraken --keepalive Restart = on-failure RestartSec = 5s [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Create a text file at /etc/systemd/system/vigilant-crypto-snatch.service and put that content into it, making these changes: Be sure to replace the placeholder USERNAME with the one where you have put the config. On a Raspberry Pi that is usually just the username pi . You can find out like this: $ echo $USER mu You also need to change the path, which you can find out by executing type vigilant-crypto-snatch on the command line. The command line flags might not be the ones you want, perhaps you want a different market place. Once you have that unit in place, you can query systemd to show you this unit: $ sudo systemctl status vigilant-crypto-snatch \u25cb vigilant-crypto-snatch.service - Vigilant Crypto Snatch Service (watch) Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/vigilant-crypto-snatch.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: inactive (dead) If you want to have this unit started on system startup, you need to enable it with sudo systemctl enable vigilant-crypto-snatch .

Consult the documentation to learn about the new format. I'm sorry for breaking your configuration, but I didn't want to provide a migration and rather deliver more new features. Version 4.1.0 Use krakenex instead of clikraken to communicate with Kraken. The old implementation is deprecated but retained with --marketplace clikraken . Add automatic withdrawal for currency when the amount exceeds a certain threshold determined by the fee. See the configuration of the Kraken marketplace for details. Version 4.2.0 \ud83e\uddea New features: Triggers can be given names in the evaluation interface. For the Kraken marketplace you can now specify whether the fees should be applied to base or quote currency. Attach a stack trace of exceptions to the Telegram message. In the drop survey evaluation one now also has a time range slider such that one can get a feeling for the drops. Some are one-time events, and others are regular patterns. \ud83d\udd27 Improvements: The reported balance at startup will only contain currencies which are used in triggers. This will remove some leftover shitcoins that people might left in their account. After a trade only the balances for that currency pair will be reported to give a cleaner report. The legend in the trigger simulation plot is shown below the plot to allow for longer trigger names without having them cropped. Triggers with failures used to get deactivated completely. Once no more triggers were active, the program was shut down. Failures stemming from insufficient funds are easily recovered from by transferring more money to the marketplace. The bot would have to be restarted afterwards. In order to make this unnecessary, failed triggers are just silenced for 12 hours. Another attempt is made automatically afterwards. This keeps the number of messages relatively low. \ud83e\udeb2 Bug fixes: Historical API was broken, it now retrieves data again. Specifying a lower-case fiat currency and using the percentage based fiat volume strategy led to an error. This is now fixed and the fiat currency is again case-insensitive. Make sure that errors from the Telegram API are reported and not ignored. Do not use Markdown with Telegram as parsing errors prevent messages from being sent. Plain text is not as pretty, but better have it reliable no matter which names the Triggers have. Errors from the historical price source have been silently ignored. They now issue a warning. \u2699\ufe0f Implementation details: clikraken has been retired and we now use krakenex in version 2. This version is in conflice with clikraken , which needs krakenex version 1. When you upgrade, you might see this message: ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts. clikraken 0.8.3.2 requires krakenex<1.0,>=0.1, but you have krakenex 2.1.0 which is incompatible. To resolve this, run pip uninstall clikraken or sudo pip uninstall clikraken , depending on whether you have installed it with --user in the past. Send Telegram messages via POST (and not GET). Automatically move the SQLite database into the appropriate user data directory on Windows on macOS, no change on Linux. Version 4.2.1 When a trigger was disabled after three consecutive failures, a message stating that would be shown every time the trigger was processed. In this way the user got the same amount of messages. This message is now removed. The initial errors speak for themselves, there is no need to have this additional message. Version 4.2.2 Another warning message would use a constant that was moved to another place in the meantime. The program crashed when the message was going to be emitted. It has been removed now. Version 4.2.3 Log output is also put into the Linux system log. In this way one can do post-mortem debugging. Crashes have been reported when the Telegram message was longer than their limit of 4096 characters. Messages are now chunked to prevent this from happening. Telegram messages are no longer directly send but stored in a send-queue. This way connection outages do not yield lost messages but rather just delay sending. Use a proper form instead of the plain button in Streamlit. Version 4.2.4 Also handle ReadTimeout errors that can happen when the API doesn't answer before the connection breaks. These have been ignored previously, but now the error message is a bit cleaner. Version 4.3.0 New features: Add a start attributes to triggers. Add --dry-run option to watch command such that it can be tested without spending money. Allow specifying delay and cooldown not only in minutes as delay_minutes and cooldown_minutes , but also as delay_hours , delay_days , cooldown_hours and cooldown_days . Add documentation for cron to Configuration . Fixes: Remove double reports of connection errors. In case that the user has no drop triggers, the database cleaning interval is set to 120 minutes. Handle requests.exceptions.ConnectionError without crashing. Fix --one-shot mode. It would previously sleep for another interval and not shut down the Telegram logger, preventing the program from a clean exit. Development: Introduce a new pre-commit hook that sorts the import statements. Version 4.3.1 Fixes: Apparently all Kraken trades were sent in the validation mode. I have tried to fix that. Version 4.3.2 Fixes: Fix automatic detection of Telegram chat ID. Do not crash when there is no balance at Kraken. Also handle requests.exceptions.HTTPError . Development: Make the marketplace package isolated, only expose a limited set of attributes in __init__.py . Version 4.3.3 Fixes: Due to an incomplete refactoring the program would crash whenever there was a non-fatal exception regarding the marketplace. This should be fixed now. Version 4.3.4 The --dry-run option would write buys into the database, although it would not buy anything on the market. Now the database should now be changed. If you need to clean up your database, you might find sqliteman helpful for that. I now use the mypy static analysis and type checker, and also found a few subtle bugs with that in code paths which aren't used often. Version 4.3.5 When the balance on the marketplace is zero, withdrawals would fail and therefore crash the whole program. This is now fixed. Version 4.4.0 Major architectural change, without changes to the user. Add test-drive command to verify configuration. Version 4.4.1 More refactoring. Also update the versions of various dependencies. The Streamlit interface is now part of the main dependencies. Version 4.4.2 Streamlit doesn't easily work on the Raspberry Pi due to issues with py-arrow and the ARM CPU. I have therefore reverted these dependencies to be an extra again. Version 4.4.3 I've accidentally deleted the source code. This should be fixed now. Version 4.4.4 The Telegram sender would not shut down gracefully. I have fixed that now. Add --version option.","title":"Version 4"},{"location":"changelog/version-4/#version-4","text":"","title":"Version 4"},{"location":"changelog/version-4/#version-400","text":"The trigger specification is significantly changed.

Would emit RuntimeError: Unsupported marketplace: <vigilant_crypto_snatch.configuration.yaml_configuration.YamlConfiguration object at 0x7f2b3a031840> . Version 5.0.2 The Telegram connector would hang during shutdown, I have fixed that again. Version 5.0.3 Catch requests.exceptions.ConnectionError , which wasn't caught by the krakenex library. Now it will be converted into an error on the module level. Version 5.1.0 Print out version number during startup. Add trigger option fear_and_greed_index_below . Version 5.2.0 Fear & Greed is now included in the evaluation interface. More refactoring, more test coverage. Developer documentation includes a component diagram. Version 5.2.1 Allow any log level for Telegram, including debug . Attempt withdrawal after the trade has been noted in the database. Previously, a failure during withdrawal would have dropped the trade and eventually performed it again. Output full exception traceback for every caught exception into the debug logging channel. Pause triggers for 24 hours when they have insufficient funds. This will reduce failure messages from three per 12 hours to one per 24 hours. Version 5.3.0 Add a report page about user trades into the evaluation interface. Link to download statistics within documentation. Add GitHub funding. Connection errors are not reported all the time, instead they are just logged as debug output. Create AssetPair data structure so better structure the code internally. Remove usage of Protocol such that Python 3.7 is still supported. Update developer documentation a bit. Update Pillow for security. Version 5.3.1 Fix bug in trade report with KeyError: 'coin' . Version 5.4.0 Add optional and voluntary telemetry sending via Sentry. See the configuration for details and how to enable it, if you want to. Add a dark mode to the documentation. Split configuration documentation onto multiple pages. Version 5.4.1 Remove the telemetry stuff again. Split usage documentation onto multiple pages. Restore Windows support by only adding syslog on Linux. Version 5.4.2 Fix path handling to database on Windows. Version 5.4.3 The database cleaning trigger would always clean all historic prices which were two hours in the past. Therefore all old prices would vanish and a lot of calls to CryptoCompare were done. This depleted the API volume needlessly. The Fear and Greed index sometimes doesn't deliver a value for the current day. In this case we will try the value from yesterday. If that doesn't exist as well, the failure will just be logged, without crashing the program. Version 5.4.4 The krakenex library would sometimes also raise a requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout , which was not caught. The program would crash. This exception type is now caught as well. Version 5.5.0 The CCXT library is now supported and gives access to more over a 100 more exchanges. Add an asset pair selector in the trade overview panel in the evaluation interface. Also add documentation for the trade overview. It is now an error when either drop percentage or delay is given, but not both at the same time. Previously this would have lead to a simple delay trigger, although the user likely wanted to have a drop trigger. The error message will make it clear that users have to update their configuration. The --marketplace command line option has been removed, the marketplace is now chosen via an entry in the configuration file. Version 5.6.0 Add support for notifications via notify.run to provide an alternative to Telegram. Also catch HTTPError in the krakenex wrapper. Version 5.7.0 A completely new GUI using Qt is now part of the project. The trigger start attribute used to discard the time part, if it was given. The start was always taken to start from midnight. This is fixed in this version. Version 5.8.0 All triggers now need to have an explicit name set in the configuration. Before a trigger is executed, the balance will be checked. Only if sufficient balance is on the marketplace, an attempt to buy is made. It may still fail because there is insufficient balance depending on the way that fees are computed. The GUI has an improved status and about screen. The GUI now shows a system tray icon and can send notifications. Logo added to the GUI window. Version 5.8.1 Allow setting a start date and time in the GUI. Version 5.9.0 This release features a lot of work on the GUI: Move some functionality into a main menu and separate windows. Add a separate window to see log messages. Add the trigger simulation functionality previously only available in the Streamlit interface. Use PySide6 instead of PyQt6 such that the whole project is under the MIT licence again. Add drop percentage to the trigger edit window.

Either do that on the General settings screen, or via another entry in the YAML file: marketplace : \"kraken\" You can specify either kraken , bitstamp or ccxt . The default currently is kraken . Kraken Go to the Kraken API key page and create an API key which has the permission to trade. There you need to create a new API key: Be sure to select the Create & Modify Orders permission such that the program can actually execute orders. Give the least amount of permissions, you should not select Withdraw Funds if you don't want to enable the automatic withdrawal feature described below. You will get an API key and an associated secret. In the GUI there are fields for that: In the configuration file you add a paragraph like the following. The first will be API key and the second will be the secret, like this: kraken : key : \"YOUR KEY\" secret : \"YOUR SECRET\" Fee policy When you trade, you will have to pay a certain fee that depends on your Kraken account tier. Whatever these are exactly, you can choose whether you would like to have them taken away from your fiat or coin amount. If you let it take away from your coin amount, buying coin for 50 EUR will only cost exactly that, but you get a bit less coin. Should you rather choose to have it taken in fiat, you will get as much coin as you want, but it will cost you more fiat. Kraken supports this as a flag to addOrder and has two options: fcib prefer fee in base currency (default if selling) fciq prefer fee in quote currency (default if buying, mutually exclusive with fcib ) As explained in their glossary , the quote currency is fiat, whereas the base currency is the coin. We support this choice via the option prefer_fee_in_base_currency , which is false by default, so the fee is preferred in quote currency. If you set this to true, you can instead have it in the base currency and only spend exactly as much as you want. In the GUI it is just a checkbox, in the configuration file you need to specify this: kraken : \u2026 prefer_fee_in_base_currency : true Automatic transfer to wallet For this marketplace we support automatic transfers to an external wallet when the crypto volume is large enough. We query the current fees and only do the transfer when the fees are below a certain percentage of the value to transfer. In order to set this up, you first need to have a withdrawal target. Go to the funding page , click on withdraw BTC for example. Then use \u201cAdd Address\u201d to create a new address and give it some name. I call mine simply \u201cWallet\u201d.

After each trade the program will check whether you are above the fee limit and start the transfer. This way you can have your marketplace account as empty as you like.

Telegram One popular choice for notifications is Telegram. First you have to create a bot by talking to @botfather . It will lead you through a couple of steps: Type /start to initiate the bot creation. Then type /newbot to create your bot. It will ask you for the name of the bot. You can just use \u201cvigilant-crypto-snatch\u201d or something else. Next it will ask for a username of the bot. This is a technical thing, so it doesn't need to be pretty.

This is done in a section triggers . You can add as many as you would like, and the options look like this: In the configuration file it would look like this: triggers : - name : \"Large drops\" coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 1440 volume_fiat : 26.0 delay_minutes : 1440 drop_percentage : 10 - name : \"Medium drops\" coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 1440 volume_fiat : 26.0 delay_minutes : 1440 drop_percentage : 5 - name : \"Regular\" coin : btc fiat : eur cooldown_minutes : 5000 volume_fiat : 26.0 There are different sub-types of triggers, but all of them have the following elements in common: coin : The name of the crypto-currency, case insensitive. fiat : The name of the fiat currency, case insensitive. cooldown_minutes , cooldown_hours , cooldown_days : Time until a trigger can fire again. If multiple ones are given, only the one with the largest unit will be used. name : Human-readable name of the trigger. The internal name of the trigger can be derived from the options. This will give you technical names in notifications, so you might prefer to give them personal names. Additionally the name is used in the database to compute the cooldown. If you don't have a name specified and change any of the parameters, the internal name will change and cooldown doesn't apply any more. start : Optional date time string which specifies the earliest execution of the trigger. This can be used if you have just created a bunch of new triggers, or made changes to them without keeping the name attribute fixed. By specifying a future point in time you can prepare a trigger without having it executed on the next run of the program. We use dateutil.parser to parse the date. It will understand most formats, but the ISO format ( YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ) will certainly work. Trigger strategy We currently have two optional trigger strategies. All strategies also use the cooldown. If you do not specify any strategy keys, then it will just buy whenever the cooldown has expired. This is the \u201cDollar cost average\u201d way. You can use as many strategies as you like. They are connected via logical and , meaning that all strategies have to say \u201cbuy\u201d in order for the trigger to fire. Drop strategy The first strategy is the drop strategy. It will look whether the price has dropped by a given percentage within a given delay . You could for instance look for a drop of 1 % within 60 minutes. You will need to specify these keys: drop_percentage delay_minutes , delay_hours or delay_days : If multiple are given, only the one with the largest unit will be used. You can specify a decimal number for the drop percentage, just be aware that it must contain a decimal point instead of a decimal comma. Fear & Greed strategy There is the Fear & Greed Index , which provides a market analysis via multiple factors. It is a number between 0 and 100. Low numbers mean that people are fearful and it might be good to buy. And high numbers mean that people are greedy and it might be a bad idea to buy. You can specify the following key to make use of this strategy. fear_and_greed_index_below : An integer value between 0 and 101 which is the exclusive upper limit for the fear and greed index. If you specify 50, then it will only buy for 49 or below. Fiat volume strategy There are two ways that you can determine the amount of fiat volume that you want to spend on each trigger execution. First there is the fixed strategy, where you always spend a fixed amount. For that you need this key: volume_fiat : Amount in fiat currency. Alternatively you can specify a percentage of the amount of fiat currency that you have on the market. For this specify a percentage: percentage_fiat : Percentage of fiat money to spend in each buy. Choosing sensible values But what shall I choose? What will give me the most return of investment? We don't have the truth either, but we recommend that you take a look at the evaluation interface that is linked on the usage page. The heatmap of drops gives you a good idea of which delays and drop percentages to use.

There are many components, and they only depend on each other in an acyclic way. First we show a diagram which contains just opaque components. The parts from this software are yellow, the external libraries are in blue. You can see that is a nice directed acyclic graph, and that the core component is independent of any external libraries. On this page we will go through all the components and how they interact with each other. This shall give you an overview of the architecture of this software. Core At the center there are the core entities, the data classes which don't depend on anything else. These are the classes representing Price and Trade . These are implemented as dataclasses . Datastore The next component is the data storage. We have an interface which allows to store price and trade objects and retrieve them. We also have a clean-up operation, and two specific queries. It is implemented using simple lists for testing, and also using the SQL Alchemy library. One can see that although this depends on an external library, it is only used in a concrete implementation of the interface. The other code doesn't expliclty depend on this storage implementation but only on the interface. And thus we have decoupled it. Marketplace Since we buy crypto currency, we need to have a marketplace. This is also hidden behind the Marketplace interface which offers a few functions. It is not a complete wrapper of any particular marketplace, but just what we need in this project. There are two concrete implementations, namely for the Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges. These implementations depend on the external libraries. Again the remainder of the code only depends on the interface. My Requests There are multiple parts in the code where I need to issue HTTP requests. For this the requests library is an excellent choice. I just don't want the exception handling to spill all over my code, so I wrap it and just catch all possible exceptions there. Historical In order to find drops, we need to know the prices in the past. These are provided by a historical source, which delivers price objects. There are many different implementations. One just asks the marketplace for the current price, that only works when the specified time is right now. For older times we can have a look into the database. But if there is no appropriate price available, it will ask on Crypto Compare. To the remainder of the program everything is hidden behind that interface. Fear & Greed For the \u201cFear & Greed Index\u201d we need to query the API. This again has an interface, such that we can test it. Triggers The triggers get specified by the user. I have generalized the trigger concept such that it just handles regular actions. These also include database cleaning and sending a Telegram notification. For the buy triggers there is a specification, the TriggerSpec . The buy trigger uses two delegates as part of the strategy pattern . One is used to determine the amount of fiat money to spend, the other is whether the trigger should be considered active. This lets us mix and match these algorithms without having an exploding inheritance hierarchy. Dependencies to other parts of the code are via the interfaces only, this way it is decoupled. Paths We need to know where to store and load configuration files, database files and cached information. For this we have the collected the paths in a module. This uses the appdir library to get user directories in a system independent manner. Telegram The message sending to Telegram is implemented as a logger with the Python standard library logging facilities. I have a logger which extends the handler. In this way I depend on something external, but it is pluggable via the logging handler mechanism in the standard library. I use the requests library for the HTTP requests, which I did not hide behind an interface. Configuration The configuration shall be independent of the file format used, it should provide some migrations and so on. All the parsing should be done there as well. At the moment I have a bunch of free functions, and they pass around lists and dicts. I am not that happy with that yet, I would like to have an interface there as well in order to mock that for tests.

To start the graphical user interface, you have to open a command line ( cmd on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and enter either vigilant-crypto-snatch-qt or something like ~/.local/bin/vigilant-crypto-snatch-qt . After pressing Enter you will see the main screen: When you start it up for the first time, the three panels will be empty until you have configured the program. Before going through the details of that, we want to show how the program is used once you have it configured and create some motivation to go through the configuration process. You have three panels there, Balances , Spot Prices and Triggers . The balances are all balances of relevant currencies on the configured marketplace. You can see that the author has like 52.98 EUR on his account, and no BTC at all. On the left you see the spot prices for all configured currencies. The author only buys BTC, so only that shows up there. The bottom panel shows the triggers . These are rulesets for buying under certain conditions. You can see one trigger per line, and one rule per column. So the first three triggers have cooled down, whereas the fourth has not. But the first three triggers wait for the drop, whereas the fourth has no drop rule. Trigger simulation In order to get a feel for the trigger rules, you can simulate them. We will also take this to explain how the triggers work. Use the main menu Simulation to open up the simulation window: On the top left you configure your trigger. It has to have a unique name in order to be identifiable in the database. This name should not be changed, or the cooldown (see next paragraph) will not work. It will work with a certain currency pair, you just enter the regular abbreviations of the currencies. The first interesting rule is the cooldown . We don't want triggers to trigger multiple times in rapid succession, depleting your fiat funds. Therefore they always have a cooldown associated. You can choose it as short as you like. Next you need to specify how much volume is to be invested. This can either be an absolute amount, where in the screenshot it would be 100 EUR. Alternatively you can select the percentage variant, and then the value will be a percentage. The delay is an optional setting, which must be set together with drop . The idea is that if the price has dropped a certain percentage compared to a reference point, the coin may be undervalued and it is a really good time to buy. If you set the delay to one week, and the percentage to 20 %, it will buy if the price right now is 20 % below the price of one week ago. As one can see in the upper center graph, the price has rapidly fallen from around 29.000 EUR/BTC to around 19.000 EUR/BTC in the course of a few days. That is a drop of 34 % within a few days. But there are also smaller-scale drops, which might also be interesting to invest in. The Fear & Greed index is a market sentiment estimation, which ranks from 0 (pure fear) to 100 (extreme greed) and basically means whether the coin is undervalued or overvalued. This not only takes into account the price itself, but also some other information sources. This can also be used as an additional rule. Sometimes one doesn't want a trigger to start right away. One can use the start attribute to delay it into the future. If one sets it to some value in the past, it is effectively unset. You can combine the additional rules for drop , fear & greed and the start freely. If you don't specify any additional rules, you end up with a plain dollar cost average where you buy coins whenever the cooldown finishes. Once you have put in the parameters, you can simulate the triggers. You can see a table of the purchases in the bottom center. Each trigger execution is one line in the table. The bottom right graph shows the money invested as well as the value of the investment at the given point in time. The bottom left table shows a summary of each simulation. This way you can run a bunch of simulations and still compare to previous runs. Log messages In case you experience strange things, have a look into the log messages via the Help menu.

Trades overview Once you have the program configured and running for a while, you can see your trades in the overview panel. Go to Report and select the trade report: This lists the amount of fiat you spend, how much coin you got, which trigger executed that trade, and how much the current value of that coin is.

We will show you the necessary steps for your platform. The way to install Python on Windows, Mac and Linux are completely different, we are going through the different systems one by one. You can use the navigation to directly jump to your platform, if you want. We also need to install different parts of this project on the platforms, so we have structured it directly by platform. On Windows For Windows, you can download Python via the Python website : Then download the Windows Installer for 64-Bit: Launch the installer, and add Python to the PATH. This will make it easier later on. Then just press \u201cInstall Now\u201d. After the setup has gone through, it will allow you to extend the command line limit. This might be necessary, I would just do that. Then you are finished and have Python installed on your system. We can then proceed to install the program. Then open a command line by pressing Windows and type \u201ccmd\u201d to launch the command line. You will see a window like this: Then type pip install 'vigilant-crypto-snatch[evaluation,gui]' and press Enter . It will start to download the latest version of the program: Eventually it will finish and show you the command line again: You should be able to start vigilant-crypto-snatch without arguments by typing that now: If you get this help screen, then everything is installed correctly. On Mac On the Mac, use Spotlight to open the Terminal application. Then just type python3 . A dialog window should open and ask you to install some developer tools. Do that, and you should have Python installed. Once this is installed, you can install it by typing pip install 'vigilant-crypto-snatch[evaluation,gui] at the command prompt. It should download the program. On Linux desktop or laptop Major Linux distributions directly ship with Python, so you don't need to install the Python interpreter yourself, it is already there. All you need to do is to open a terminal type pip install 'vigilant-crypto-snatch[evaluation,gui] . This will install the project for your user only. You have to make sure that ~/.local/bin is part of your PATH environment variable such that you can start the program. If you want to install it for all users into the system path, you can also prepend a sudo to the command line.

There are multiple variables that have to be tuned for each trigger: Time delay Cooloff Drop percentage Fiat volume We can try to verify a given strategy using historical data. We can also use the historical data to get an idea of a good strategy. Then we just simulate the given triggers and see how they perform. We provide a fun experimentation interface which is built with Streamlit and runs directly in your browser. This interface can be used online using the hosted version . Alternatively it can be started locally using the evaluate subcommand without any additional parameters: vigilant-crypto-snatch evaluate You can then select a crypto and a fiat currency to use for the analysis. Then you can just switch between the various tools that are offered. These are described below. Possible errors It might be possible that you cannot start the Streamlit interface. The most basic error could be an ImportError saying that the package altair or streamlit could not be imported. In that case you haven't installed the evaluation extra. See the installation instructions on the front page. While starting it, you might get an error about too many files connected via inotify. In this case you need to create a file at .streamlit/config.toml and give it this content: [server] fileWatcherType = \"none\" Price tool Here you can just see the prices that we got from the historical API. This is nothing special, just a plot. These plots are slightly interactive, so you can make them fullscreen and they will render with higher quality. Trigger simulation tool You simulate triggers on historical data. You can limit the evaluation data to a given range. Unfortunately Streamlit doesn't support a range slider yet, so the numbers don't make so much sense. The actual date is shown right below and will be updated as you move the slider. You can simulate as many triggers as you like. Set the number that you want and then just select the type of trigger and tune the parameters to your liking. It will give you a summary table looks like this: You can make this table full screen and also sort by any column. Just click on a column header and it will sort. You will also get a plot which shows the amount of money you have invested as well as the value of the crypto assets aquired. With this you can get a sense on the gains. The plot is interactive, you can pan and zoom with the mouse. You also have a table with the trades that were performed. In case the trigger has not been executed once, you will of course get a message. Drop survey tool Fiddling with individual triggers can be informative, but a more meta view could be very helpful. For this all sorts of drop triggers are performed, with a grid of various delays and various drop percentages. You can control the ranges of both with two-way sliders. Each time such a trigger is executed a fixed unit of fiat currency is invested. At the end of the time period the amount of crypto currency is normalized by the amount of fiat currency spent. This will show the most efficient triggers. It doesn't show how often these triggers have been used, or how much crypto currency you will have in the end. In the resulting heat map you can see colored areas where the most gains are in a dark red. In regions where the trigger has never been executed, you will just see black. These regions indicate that there was no such drop in the period looked at. Likely there will be one really dark area. This is an artefact from a single large drop in the past three months. Of course this is the best drop trigger for that particluar period, but it does not really generalize. So be wary that different historical periods look differently. Use this plot to get a general sense of fluctuations in the market and which triggers would fire often and form a good base strategy. In the above image, having a trigger at around 10 % and 24 hours delay seems to be a reasonable choice. You might still want to include some really ambitious triggers such that you can realize large gains. For instance having one for 25 % within 48 hours could be a good idea. Trade overview When you use the evaluation interface locally with your database, you can also see an overview over all the recorded trades from the software. There is one plot similar to the one shown by investment portfolio services. You can see the value of your bought coins and the spent fiat over time. The spent money is with the solid line, the value of your coins in the solid area. The plot is only updated when there is another trade, it doesn't try to look up historical prices in between. Then there is an overview over the amount of fiat that was spent over the months: This can help you to keep your budget in check and potentially reduce the triggers a bit. Value with current price Then we have plots which are potentially confusing because they compare historic investments with the current price. This means that the plots will change whenever you look at them again. It makes it a bit hard to evaluate the strategy, but perhaps they can be useful still. One is with the gains from each trigger execution, compared to the current price: And also grouped by month: Depending on the current price, everything will be shift up or down. It will change historic benefits as well.
